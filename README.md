# School District Scores & Spending
Analysis of individual and district math and reading scores, with deeper analysis into the relationship between the scores and school funding

## Updated Figures
Possible data corruption at the 9th grade level at Thomas High School.  For further, cleaner analysis, the math and reading scores for this grade at this school have been elimiated to better compare against other schools with even metrics.

Comparing the original data to the updated data that dropped the math and reading scores at the affected school, there's little change district-wide, though the metrics at Thomas High School do change slightly.

|Thomas High School|Average Math Score|Average Reading Score|% Passing Math|% Passing Reading|% Overall Passing|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Including 9th Grade|83.42|83.85|93.3|97.3|90.9|
|Excluding 9th Grade|83.35|83.9|93.2|97.0|90.6|

By eliminating the 9th grade testing from the school results, the average math score does drop, though by less than a tenth of a percentage point.  Interestingly, by excluding the 9th graders, the school reading score actually increases.

Even with the minor variations, there's no change within the rankings of all schools in the district.  Thomas High School still ranks as the number two school in terms of overall percentage of students passing both the math and reading assesments.

| |School Type|Average Math Score|Average Reading Score|% Passing Math|% Passing Reading|% Overall Passing|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cabrera High School|Charter|83.061895|83.975780|94.133477|97.039828|91.334769|
|**Thomas High School**|**Charter**|**83.350937**|**83.896082**|**93.185690**|**97.018739**|**90.630324**|
|Griffin High School|Charter|83.351499|83.816757|93.392371|97.138965|90.599455|
|Wilson High School|Charter|83.274201|83.989488|93.867718|96.539641|90.582567|

While there are minor changes in data for the testing scores at Thomas High School, other metrics, including overall budget and per-student budget remain the same as there's no change in number of students attending school.

## Spending Analysis
Though pedestrian logic may expect the higher the budget, the higher the test scores, this analysis does show some unexpected results.  Based on the information provided, as the budget-per-student increases, the test scores decrease.

Warranting further analysis, this may also be partially attributed to school size.  The lowest performing schools also have some of the largest student bodies in the district.  Further analysis of the student to teacher ratio may shine more light on seeminly out-of-place results.

|Spending Per Student|Average Math Score|Average Reading Score|% Passing Math|% Passing Reading|% Overall Passing|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|<$584|83.5|83.9|93|97|90|
|$585-629|81.9|83.2|87|93|81|
|$630-644|78.5|81.6|73|84|63|
|$645-675|77.0|81.0|66|81|54|

## Final Analysis
Without knowing the depths of corruption of the 9th grade scores at Thomas High School, specific analysis isn't possible.  However, by looking at the minor changes in data by eliminating the 9th grade scores, it's very possible the corrupt data wasn't widespread.  In fact, the **higher** reading scores after eliminating the 9th grade tests may indicate any corruption only occurred in the math portion of the testing.
